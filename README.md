# [Project 1: Rx Lens Thickness Calculator](https.//github.com/TEMPORARY-PLACEHOLDER)
* This R Shiny app calculates and visualizes the thickness of lenses in Rx glasses. 
* Cheaper lenses are thicker but have less chromatic aberration. 
* This color spiting at the peripheral of the lens like a prism is especially pronounced with LED read outs and white street lights.
* This aberration harms the resolution and usability of the lenses at their edges.
* Night driving, large TVs, and LED signs are particularly problimatic when experancing chromatic aberration.
* Cheap lenses are always thicker which is why expensive lenses are often encouraged by sales associates.
* However, if the lenses do not protured out of the frame, then the thickness is not noticed. 
* This calculation provided me with better vision quality and $150 savings.
