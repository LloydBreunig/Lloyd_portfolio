# [Project 1: Weather Report](https://github.com/LloydBreunig/Lloyd_portfolio/blob/main/weather_project.ipynb)
* This Python project pulls data from 3 different APIs.
* These API calls determin you location, and then get raw weather data & times of solar events.
* Visulizations are made for 1 day & 7 day weather reports.
* Exploritory data analysis was done as a demonstreation of skills.
* The data with strong corrilations are unsurprissing.
* This project was motivated by the volenteer work that I do with non-profits.
* Much of this work is done outdoors in very remote areas that lack internet or cell service.
* So, I wrote a program that gets the weather data we need with the smallest internet bandwith.
* Normal apps download video & hi resolution images.
* This app only downloads simple JSON files and does all the rendering locally.

# [Project 2: Rx Lens Thickness Calculator](https://github.com/LloydBreunig/Lloyd_portfolio/blob/main/Rx%20glasses%20shiny%20app.R)
* This R Shiny app calculates and visualizes the thickness of lenses in Rx glasses. 
* Cheap lenses are always thicker which is why expensive lenses are encouraged by sales associates.
* Cheaper lenses are thicker but have less chromatic aberration. 
* This is the color spiting at the peripheral of the lens like a prism.
* This aberration harms the resolution and usability of the lenses at their edges.
* Night driving, large TVs, and LED signs are particularly problimatic with chromatic aberration.
* However, if the lenses do not protured out of the frame, then the thickness is not noticed. 
* I built this calculator to test my hypothisis that I could have better vision quality and $150 in savings.
* My new glasses are really nice & my eye doctor was surprised with the results.

# [Project 3: Tableau Visualizations & Dashboards](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lloyd.breunig#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0)

* There are multiple visualiations & dashboard examples of my Tableau skills.
