# [Project 1: Rx Lens Thickness Calculator] (https.//github.com/TEMPORARY-PLACEHOLDER)
* This R Shiny app calculates and visualizes the thickness of your Rx glasses. 
* Cheaper lenses are thicker but have less chromatic aberration. 
* This color spiting at the peripheral of the lens like a prism is especially pronounced with LED read outs and white street lights.
* This aberration harms the resolution and usability of the lenses at their edges.
* Cheap lenses are always thicker which is why expensive lenses are often encouraged by sales associates.
* However, if the lenses do not protured out of the frame, then the thickness does not matter. 
* This calculation provided me with better vision quality and $100 savings.
